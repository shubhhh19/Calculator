# Calculator

### Features:
This Python calculator performs basic arithmetic operations. The available features include:

- Addition: Adds two numbers.
- Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
- Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
- Division: Divides one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.
- User-Friendly Menu: Easy-to-use menu to select operations.
- Exit Option: Allows the user to exit the program gracefully.

### Installation and Run Instructions:
Clone the repo and run it in any IDE

### Interesting Parts during the Build Process:
- Implementing error handling for division by zero was an interesting challenge. By checking if the divisor is zero before performing the division, I ensured the program could handle this edge case gracefully and inform the user of the error.
- Breaking down the calculator operations into separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division helped in organizing the code. This modular approach made the code more readable and easier to maintain.

### Difficulties Faced and Solutions:
- One of the challenges was ensuring that the user inputs were valid numbers and within the expected range of choices. Initially, the program would crash if a non-integer input was provided. To solve this, I added input validation to handle incorrect inputs more gracefully.
